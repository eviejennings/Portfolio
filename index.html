            developing my own sites using code I integrated different SEO
            techniques into the site.

                The first project I worked on during my apprenticeship was
                Disso. Disso was an open collaboration platform for students and
                businesses to tackle real-world problems through innovative
                projects. <br />I designed this site on WebFlow using a
                prototype made in Figmas as inspiration. I soon moved on to
                adding a blog to improve our SEO using WebFlow's CMS
                Collections. <br />The site has been taken down by my old
                company as the project is no longer in play, however, I have
                linked a portfolio project I completed as part of my
                apprenticeship, explaining the process I went through to create
                the site.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                The first website that I created outside of work, for one of my
                coding qualifications with SheCodes, was a website about
                Schiaparelli. <br />I created the site in VSCode simply using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                My favourite project so far has been this. For my second coding
                qualification with SheCodes, I created a weather application for
                the web. <br />
                For this project I used Git, GitHub and VSCode, to build the
                site out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br />
                In this project, I learned how to use and connect APIs to your
                site within JavaScript to create a 'real-time' interactive site
                for users.
